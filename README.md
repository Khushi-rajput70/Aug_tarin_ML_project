# Aug_tarin_ML_project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end **Machine Learning pipeline** using the **Aug dataset**.  
It covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, outlier detection, model building, and performance evaluation.  
The goal of this project is to **train and compare different ML models** to make accurate predictions.
